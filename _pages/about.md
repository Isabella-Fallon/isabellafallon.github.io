Research Interests:
Neural mechanisms underlying skilled movements, sustained performance, and motor sequences. Biofeedback systems, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive neural interfaces.

Isabella Fallon is a postdoctoral associate working under Dr. Henry Yin at Duke University School of Medicine. Her research focuses on how neural circuits generate skilled movements. She aims to apply this knowledge to develop innovative biomedical devices that restore lost motor function.

In May 2024, Isabella earned her PhD in Neurobiology from Duke University School of Medicine, where she studied the role of striatal circuits in decision-making and kinematics under the mentorship of Dr. Henry Yin. Her work uncovered a novel "push-pull" mechanism in striatal circuits that determines movement trajectories toward goal-directed targets.

In May 2017, she received her B.S. in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder. There, under the guidance of Dr. Steven Maier, she investigated the neural prophylactic effects of exercise and control on stress. Her achievements earned her several honors, including the Best Undergraduate Thesis in Neuroscience out of 150 students, the 2018 Women Who Make a Difference award, and multiple research grants and fellowships, such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program-HHMI Research Grant, and the Biological Sciences Initiative Scholars Program Summer Award.

Isabella is deeply committed to mentoring students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. She has served as a mentor through the URS program at Duke University, the Duke Athletics Student Mentorship Program, and the BSI and UROP programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Isabella loves traveling and learning about different cultures, eating, dancing, and spending time in the outdoors (skiing, trail running, climbing, hiking, playing sports) - she is excited about all things in life!
