Research Interests:
Neural mechanisms underlying skilled movements, sustained performance, and motor sequences. Biofeedback systems and adaptive neural interfaces.

Isabella Fallon is a postdoctoral associate working under Dr. Polina Anikeeva at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is developing neurobiologically inspired technologies to restore and enhance functions lost due to nervous system injury or disease. 

In May 2024, Isabella earned her PhD in Neurobiology from Duke University School of Medicine, where she investigated how motor sequences and dexterous movements are regulated by a group of nuclei called the basal ganglia under the mentorship of Dr. Henry Yin. Her work uncovered a novel "push-pull" neural circuit mechanism that determines movement trajectories towards goal targets.

In May 2017, she received her B.A. in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder. There, under the guidance of Dr. Steven Maier, she investigated the neural prophylactic effects of exercise and control on stress. Her achievements earned her several honors, including the Best Undergraduate Thesis in Neuroscience out of 150 students, the 2018 Women Who Make a Difference award, and multiple research grants and fellowships, such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program-HHMI Research Grant.

Isabella is deeply committed to mentoring students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. She has served as a mentor through the URS program at Duke University, the Duke Athletics Student Mentorship Program, and the BSI and UROP programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Isabella loves traveling, doing yoga, dancing, and spending time in the outdoors (skiing, trail running, climbing) - she is excited about all things in life!
