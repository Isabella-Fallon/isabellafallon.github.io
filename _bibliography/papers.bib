  title={Multiple Sex- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms Underlie Exercise-Induced Stress Resistance},
  author={Tanner MK, Mellert SM, Fallon IP, Baratta MV, Greenwood BN},
  abstract={Prior physical activity reduces the risk of future stress-related mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Rodents allowed to engage in voluntary wheel running are similarly protected from behavioral consequences of stress. The present review summarizes current knowledge on mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance. A conceptual framework involving the development (during exercise) and expression (during stress) of stress resistance from exercise is proposed. During the development of stress resistance, adaptations involving multiple exercise signals and molecular mediators occur within neural circuits orchestrating various components of the stress response, which then respond differently to stress during the expression of stress resistance. Recent data indicate that the development and expression of stress resistance from exercise involve multiple independent mechanisms that depend on sex, stressor severity, and behavioral outcome. Recent insight into the role of the prefrontal cortex in exercise-induced stress resistance illustrates these multiple mechanisms. This knowledge has important implications for the design of future experiments aimed at identifying the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance.},

  title={The role of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus in action initiation and steering},
  author={Fallon IP, Hughes RN, Severino FPU, Kim N, Lawry CM, Watson GDR, Roschina M, Yin HH},
  abstract={The parafascicular (Pf) nucleus of the thalamus has been implicated in arousal and attention, but its contributions to behavior remain poorly characterized. Here, using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics, and 3D motion capture, we studied the role of the Pf nucleus in behavior using a continuous reward-tracking task in freely moving mice. We found that many Pf neurons precisely represent vector components of velocity, with a strong preference for ipsiversive movements. Their activity usually leads velocity, suggesting that Pf output is critical for self-initiated orienting behavior. To test this hypothesis, we expressed excitatory or inhibitory opsins in VGlut2+ Pf neurons to manipulate neural activity bidirectionally. We found that selective optogenetic stimulation of these neurons consistently produced ipsiversive head turning, whereas inhibition stopped turning and produced downward movements. Taken together, our results suggest that the Pf nucleus can send continuous top-down commands that specify detailed action parameters (e.g., direction and speed of the head), thus providing guidance for orienting and steering during behavior.},

  title={Force tuning explains changes in phasic dopamine signaling during stimulus-reward learning.},
  author={Bakhurin K, Hughes, RN, Jiang Q, Fallon IP Yin, HH},
  abstract={According to a popular hypothesis, phasic dopamine (DA) activity encodes a reward prediction error (RPE) necessary for reinforcement learning. However, recent work showed that DA neurons are necessary for performance rather than learning. One limitation of previous work on phasic DA signaling and RPE is the limited behavioral measures. Here, we measured subtle force exertion while recording and manipulating DA activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during stimulus-reward learning. We found two major populations of DA neurons that increased firing before forward and backward force exertion. Force tuning is the same regardless of learning, reward predictability, or outcome valence. Changes in the pattern of force exertion can explain results traditionally used to support the RPE hypothesis, such as modulation by reward magnitude, probability, and unpredicted reward delivery or omission. Thus VTA DA neurons are not used to signal RPE but to regulate force exertion during motivated behavior.},

  author={Hassell JE, Baratta MV, Fallon IP, Siebler PH, Karns BL, Nguyen KT, Gates CA, Fonken LK, Frank MG, Maier SF, Lowry CA},
  abstract={Stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), affect millions of people world-wide each year. Individuals with stress-related psychiatric disorders have been found to have poor immunoregulation, increased proinflammatory markers, and dysregulation of fear memory. The “Old Friends” hypothesis proposes that a lack of immunoregulatory inputs has led to a higher prevalence of inflammatory disorders and stress-related psychiatric disorders, in which inappropriate inflammation is thought to be a risk factor. Immunization with a soil-derived saprophytic bacterium with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659, can lower proinflammatory biomarkers, increase stress resilience, and, when given prior to or after fear conditioning in a rat model of fear-potentiated startle, enhance fear extinction. In this study, we investigated whether immunization with heat-killed M. vaccae NCTC 11659 would enhance fear extinction in contextual or auditory-cued fear conditioning paradigms and whether M. vaccae NCTC 11659 would prevent stress-induced exaggeration of fear expression or stress-induced resistance to extinction learning. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were immunized with M. vaccae NCTC 11659 (subcutaneous injections once a week for three weeks), and underwent either: Experiment 1) one-trial contextual fear conditioning; Experiment 2) two-trial contextual fear conditioning; Experiment 3) stress-induced enhancement of contextual fear conditioning; Experiment 4) stress-induced enhancement of auditory-cued fear conditioning; or Experiment 5) stress-induced enhancement of auditory-cued fear conditioning exploring short-term memory. Immunizations with M. vaccae NCTC 11659 had no effect on one- or two-trial contextual fear conditioning or contextual fear extinction, with or without exposure to inescapable stress. However, inescapable stress increased resistance to auditory-cued fear extinction. Immunization with M. vaccae NCTC 11659 prevented the stress-induced increase in resistance to auditory-cued fear extinction learning. Finally, in an auditory-cued fear conditioning paradigm exploring short-term memory and fear acquisition, immunization with M. vaccae did not prevent fear acquisition, either with or without exposure to inescapable stress, consistent with the hypothesis that M. vaccae NCTC 11659 has no effect on fear acquisition but enhances fear extinction. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased immunoregulation following immunization with M. vaccae NCTC 11659 promotes stress resilience, in particular by preventing stress-induced resistance to fear extinction, and may be a potential therapeutic intervention for trauma- and stressor-related disorders such as PTSD.},

@article{Elevated,
  title={Elevated prefrontal dopamine interferes with the stress-buffering properties of behavioral control in female rats.},
  author={McNulty CJ*, Fallon IP*, Amat J, Sanchez RJ, Leslie NR, Root DH, Maier SF, Baratta MV},
  abstract={Stress-linked disorders are more prevalent in women than in men and differ in their clinical presentation. Thus, investigating sex differences in factors that promote susceptibility or resilience to stress outcomes, and the circuit elements that mediate their effects, is important. In male rats, instrumental control over stressors engages a corticostriatal system involving the prelimbic cortex (PL) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that prevent many of the sequelae of stress exposure. Interestingly, control does not buffer against stress outcomes in females, and here, we provide evidence that the instrumental controlling response in females is supported instead by the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Additionally, we used in vivo microdialysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and receptor subtype pharmacology to examine the contribution of prefrontal dopamine (DA) to the differential impact of behavioral control. Although both sexes preferentially expressed D1 receptor mRNA in PL GABAergic neurons, there were robust sex differences in the dynamic properties of prefrontal DA during controllable stress. Behavioral control potently attenuated stress-induced DA efflux in males, but not females, who showed a sustained DA increase throughout the entire stress session. Importantly, PL D1 receptor blockade (SCH 23390) shifted the proportion of striatal activity from the DLS to the DMS in females and produced the protective effects of behavioral control. These findings suggest a sex-selective mechanism in which elevated DA in the PL biases instrumental responding towards prefrontal-independent striatal circuitry, thereby eliminating the protective impact of coping with stress.},

  author={Zhang J, Hughes RN, Kim N, Fallon IP, Bakhurin K, Kim J, Severino FPU, Yin HH},
  abstract={Optogenetics and calcium imaging can be combined to simultaneously stimulate and record neural activity in vivo. However, this usually requires two-photon microscopes, which are not portable nor affordable. Here we report the design and implementation of a miniaturized one-photon endoscope for performing simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging. By integrating digital micromirrors, the endoscope makes it possible to activate any neuron of choice within the field of view, and to apply arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns of photostimulation while imaging calcium activity. We used the endoscope to image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway in freely moving mice while activating any chosen neuron in the field of view. The endoscope also allows for the selection of neurons based on their relationship with specific animal behaviour, and to recreate the behaviour by mimicking the natural neural activity with photostimulation. The miniaturized endoscope may facilitate the study of how neural activity gives rise to behaviour in freely moving animals.},

  author={Watson GDR, Hughes RN, Petter EA, Fallon IP, Kim N, Severino FPU, Yin HH},
  abstract={The parafascicular nucleus (Pf) of the thalamus provides major projections to the basal ganglia, a set of subcortical nuclei involved in action initiation. Here, we show that Pf projections to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but not to the striatum, are responsible for movement initiation. Because the STN is a major target of deep brain stimulation treatments for Parkinson’s disease, we tested the effect of selective stimulation of Pf-STN projections in a mouse model of PD. Bilateral dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA created complete akinesia in mice, but Pf-STN stimulation immediately and markedly restored a variety of natural behaviors. Our results therefore revealed a functionally novel neural pathway for the initiation of movements that can be recruited to rescue movement deficits after dopamine depletion. They not only shed light on the clinical efficacy of conventional STN DBS but also suggest more selective and improved stimulation strategies for the treatment of parkinsonian symptoms.},

@article{Differences,

  author={Fallon IP, Tanner MK, Greenwood BN, Baratta MV},
  abstract={Adverse life events can lead to stable changes in brain structure and function and are considered primary sources of risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, most individuals do not develop these conditions following exposure to traumatic experiences, and research efforts have identified a number of experiential factors associated with an individual's ability to withstand, adapt to and facilitate recovery from adversity. While multiple animal models of stress resilience exist, so that the detailed biological mechanisms can be explored, studies have been disproportionately conducted in male subjects even though the prevalence and presentation of stress-linked disorders differ between sexes. This review focuses on (a) the mechanisms by which experiential factors (behavioral control over a stressor, exercise) reduce the impact of adverse events as studied in males; (b) whether other manipulations (ketamine) that buffer against stress-induced sequelae engage the same circuit features; and (c) whether these processes operate similarly in females. We argue that investigation of experiential factors that produce resistance/resilience rather than vulnerability to adversity will generate a unique set of biological mechanisms that potentially underlie sex differences in mood disorders.},
