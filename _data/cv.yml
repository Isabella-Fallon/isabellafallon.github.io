    - title: Postdoctoral Researcher
      institution: Yin Laboratory, Duke University
      year: 2024 - present
      description:
        - Carrying out cutting-edge research on the neural mechanisms underlying skilled dexterous movements and kinematics.
        - Mentoring PhD and undergraduate students.
        
    - title: Graduate Researcher
      institution:Yin Laboratory, Duke University School of Medicine 
      year: 2019-2024
      description:
        - Designed and programmed a novel operant task to measure decision making and kinematics.
        - Used kinematic and operant analysis of rodent behavior to understand task related movements.
        - Measured pathway activities using in-vivo calcium imaging to analyze their relationship to behavior.
        - Manipulated pathway activities with optogenetics to understand their functional contributions.
        - Developed a ‘push-pull’ model of how striatal pathways regulate movement trajectory.

    - title: Professor of Theoretical Physics
      institution: Karl-Ferdinand University, Prague, Czechoslovakia
      year: 1911 - 1917
      description:
        - I researched the prophylactic effects of exercise on traumatic stress and the related neurobiological mechanisms.

    - title: Undergraduate Research Assistant
      institution: Maier Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder
      year: 2014 - 2017
      description: 
        - I researched the neural mechanisms underlying stress resilience. My work identified a key sex difference in stress outcomes and its neurobiological substrate.
