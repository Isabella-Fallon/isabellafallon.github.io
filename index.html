<p>Research Interests:
Neural mechanisms underlying skilled movements, sustained performance, and motor sequences. Biofeedback systems, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive neural interfaces.</p>

<p>Isabella Fallon is a postdoctoral associate working under Dr. Henry Yin at Duke University School of Medicine. Her research advances our understanding of how motor sequences and dexterous movements are
executed by the nervous system. She wants to translate these biological insights into neurotechnologies that restore and enhance functions lost by the nervous system.</p>

<p>In May 2024, Isabella earned her PhD in Neurobiology from Duke University School of Medicine, where she investigated how the direct and indirect pathways of the Basal Ganglia control motor sequences under the mentorship of Dr. Henry Yin. Her work uncovered a novel “push-pull” mechanism in these pathways that determines movement trajectories towards spatial goal targets.</p>

<p>In May 2017, she received her B.A. in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder. There, under the guidance of Dr. Steven Maier, she investigated the neural prophylactic effects of exercise and control on stress. Her achievements earned her several honors, including the Best Undergraduate Thesis in Neuroscience out of 150 students, the 2018 Women Who Make a Difference award, and multiple research grants and fellowships, such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program-HHMI Research Grant.</p>

<p>Isabella is deeply committed to mentoring students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. She has served as a mentor through the URS program at Duke University, the Duke Athletics Student Mentorship Program, and the BSI and UROP programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

<p>Isabella loves traveling and learning about different cultures, eating, dancing, and spending time in the outdoors (skiing, trail running, climbing, hiking, playing sports) - she is excited about all things in life!</p>

        <p>The parafascicular (Pf) nucleus of the thalamus has been implicated in arousal and attention, but its contributions to behavior remain poorly characterized. Here, using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics, and 3D motion capture, we studied the role of the Pf nucleus in behavior using a continuous reward-tracking task in freely moving mice. We found that many Pf neurons precisely represent vector components of velocity, with a strong preference for ipsiversive movements. Their activity usually leads velocity, suggesting that Pf output is critical for self-initiated orienting behavior. To test this hypothesis, we expressed excitatory or inhibitory opsins in VGlut2+ Pf neurons to manipulate neural activity bidirectionally. We found that selective optogenetic stimulation of these neurons consistently produced ipsiversive head turning, whereas inhibition stopped turning and produced downward movements. Taken together, our results suggest that the Pf nucleus can send continuous top-down commands that specify detailed action parameters (e.g., direction and speed of the head), thus providing guidance for orienting and steering during behavior.</p>

        <p>Optogenetics and calcium imaging can be combined to simultaneously stimulate and record neural activity in vivo. However, this usually requires two-photon microscopes, which are not portable nor affordable. Here we report the design and implementation of a miniaturized one-photon endoscope for performing simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging. By integrating digital micromirrors, the endoscope makes it possible to activate any neuron of choice within the field of view, and to apply arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns of photostimulation while imaging calcium activity. We used the endoscope to image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway in freely moving mice while activating any chosen neuron in the field of view. The endoscope also allows for the selection of neurons based on their relationship with specific animal behaviour, and to recreate the behaviour by mimicking the natural neural activity with photostimulation. The miniaturized endoscope may facilitate the study of how neural activity gives rise to behaviour in freely moving animals.</p>

        <p>The parafascicular nucleus (Pf) of the thalamus provides major projections to the basal ganglia, a set of subcortical nuclei involved in action initiation. Here, we show that Pf projections to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but not to the striatum, are responsible for movement initiation. Because the STN is a major target of deep brain stimulation treatments for Parkinson’s disease, we tested the effect of selective stimulation of Pf-STN projections in a mouse model of PD. Bilateral dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA created complete akinesia in mice, but Pf-STN stimulation immediately and markedly restored a variety of natural behaviors. Our results therefore revealed a functionally novel neural pathway for the initiation of movements that can be recruited to rescue movement deficits after dopamine depletion. They not only shed light on the clinical efficacy of conventional STN DBS but also suggest more selective and improved stimulation strategies for the treatment of parkinsonian symptoms.</p>
